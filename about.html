                Reversi (also known as Othello) is a pretty simple game. It consists of a 8x8 (or 4x4 and 6x6) square
                board, and pieces
                with one black and one white side. Each player has a color, and the aim of the game is to get more of
                your pieces on the board than the opponent's pieces.
            </p>
            <h3 class="gameplay-title mt-5">Gameplay</h3>
            <p class="gameplay">
                At the start of the game there are four pieces on the board, two white and two black. You must try to
                capture opponent pieces and flip them over so they turn into your color. You do this by making a
                horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of pieces, where your pieces surround the other player's pieces.
                The surrounded opponent pieces are then captured and will be flipped over to your color, increasing the
                number of your pieces on the board.

                Example: You have the black pieces. There is one black piece on the board, next to it are 4 white pieces
                in a line. You put a black piece at the end of the line, now you have 4 white pieces between 2 black
                pieces, so those white pieces turn to black.

                Every move you make must capture some opponent pieces. This means that every time it's your turn you
                must place one of your pieces next to a line of one or more opponent pieces, where there's another one
                of your pieces at the other end of the line. It sounds complicated, but we show you the available
                squares for moves with semi-transparent circles, so it's easy to learn the game once you start playing.

                If there is no available move on the board that captures pieces then you must say Pass and your opponent
                gets to play again. If both players say pass in a row then there are no more moves on the board and the
                game ends. Usually it ends when the board is completely full though.

                The game ends when the board is full, both players say pass, or one player surrenders. At that time
                the pieces on the board are counted and the player with more pieces wins.
